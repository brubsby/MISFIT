A remote server is defined by a path MISFIT monitors where the path is in UNC format. (start with \\SOME_MACHINE_NAME)
MISFITserver.exe and SendCtrlCode.exe go on the remote server you want to control. 

If MISFIT can already read and write to the remote PC's directories it should have no problem communicate with MISFITserver which run over Named Pipes.



MISFIT server requires two command line arguments
1. The name of a batch file to execute when it receives the START command
2. The process name* to STOP,KILL or INQUIRE about.

*Specify the name of a process running in memory that you want stopped. 

The process name is a friendly name for the process, such as MFAKTO or MFAKTC, which does not include the .exe extension or the path. 

TaskManager is useful in determining the process name if you don't know it.

All processes with the same name will be stopped when executed. 

Processes will be stopped by sending CTRL-C signal to their console. To accomplish this MISFIT calls the external program named SendCtrlCode.exe 
which then sends the CTRL-C signal.
